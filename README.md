### Project Description
[our project is a character detetcting website by asking some questions to the user]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Many online personality quizzes are too long, boring, and take themselves too seriously. Users lose interest quickly, and the results feel generic.
Also, most do not include a local cultural touch that makes them relatable for Indian audiences.

### The Solution 
We created a short, humorous quiz called ‚ÄúAmmayi or Swag Personality Detector‚Äù that uses culturally relatable and funny questions.
The quiz is quick to answer, gives instant results, and includes fun background images (like an ‚ÄúAnnoying Aunty‚Äù and ‚ÄúCool Swag Girl‚Äù) to make it visually entertaining.

### Project Documentation
For Software:This is a fun and useless personality quiz website that tells the user if they are more like an "Ammayi" (old-fashioned person with traditional mindset) or "Swag" (cool, chill, modern generation mindset).
The quiz asks funny and realistic questions, calculates the result, and displays it on the screen with a colorful background.The main objective is to entertain users with a humorous quiz. It is not meant for serious personality analysis but purely for fun.The user answers a set of multiple-choice questions.

Each answer increases either the Ammayi Score or Swag Score.

At the end, the program checks which score is higher.
